15  reusable code for ts for hal
15.1 disable post server if no simulation selected
15.1 dynamic embedding of linked resource based on ?fields  
15.2 PR to PartialResponse to expose public parsing of ?fields - not needed anymore, only one method used and it's copy pasted

15.25 try to merge getters and queries for model
15.3 PR to hal-4-angular to extend get(id) with options

	PR to WebApi.hal for empty collections
20.1 improve POST, take a look into hal-angular POST (set props instead of links)
20.2 use fields? in POST, pass request builder to creation form - not needed
18  figure out why server is null after created on form
27  fix slow opening of server/id page => Replaced hrefs with router link to prevent whole page reload 
55  regulate _embedded data for pure HAL without ?fields
52  why servers are not loaded from first attempt (fixed by Webhal.Api owners)
57  remove mixing of API and Front end hrefs in templates (don't use link from API to redirect)

Platform Todo:
18  think about API point plugin entry

Done:
